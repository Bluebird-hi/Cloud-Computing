## Description

In this course you will learn how to collect, store, wrangle and display cartographic data in a cloud-based setting. You will learn reproducible approaches for pulling spatial data from APIs with emphasis on PostGIS, Airflow, and BigQuery; to wrangle these data in Python and/or JavaScript; and visualize in various platforms including Carto and Metabase. You will build your own APIs and develop your own custom web applications. This course is the second in a progression toward building web-based systems using geospatial data, and expands on the Fall course in JavaScript Programming for Planning.
